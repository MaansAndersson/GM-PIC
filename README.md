# GM-PIC

## Install
As this is an developing library we assume a "development mode"
```python3 -m venv Plasma-PEPSC```
activate the virtual env
```source .Plasma-PEPSC/bin/activate ```
install library with pip
```python3 -m pip install -e . ```

## Example
Simulate the 1D Two-Stream Instability
``` python3 examples/with_PhilipMoczPIC.py ```

## Gaussian Mixture
Describe algorithm here

## Particle-In-Cell
Code calculates the motions of electrons under the Poisson-Maxwell equation using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method.
